# Paintman
## Why make a painting app?
One day I decided that I want to try enter the golden demon competition. Realised I'm nowhere near good enough, so I decided that atleast when I'm painting I can catalogue my paints and have defined painting schemes. I don't know how long these schemes will last due to my propensity to mix on my palette but atleast I'll have a starting point

## Tech stack
### Frameworks
Initially I was going to write this in elixir using the phoenix framework with liveview for my frontend, I might still but for now:

Frontend:
- React (Typescript) - [structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)
- vite build tool
- radix-ui

Backend:
- ~~Phoenix (Elixir)~~
- Gin (Golang)

I've swapped to golang for my backend for now.
I'll either refactor the entire app to use phoenix with ecto and liveview or my next application will be phoenix

### Addons
